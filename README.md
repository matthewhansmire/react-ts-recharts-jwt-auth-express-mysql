# Full-Stack Challenge (CPU Usage Hours Dashboard)

This challenge is the build a simple dashboard application.

This application must:

1. Load the data (`cpu_hours.csv`) on the client from a server (REST API).

2. Visualize the data on the client as a chart.

Our preference is React/TypeScript (Client) + Django/Python (Server), but you may complete the challenge using your choice of language(s) and framework(s).

We have provided some basic scaffolding to get you started (Vite/React/TypeScript client, Django/Python server or Express/TypeScript server).

If you have extra time, consider extending the functionality of your solution. Add anything else you think would be cool :)

Have fun!

#### Some example feature extensions:

* Chart Hover Tooltips

* Chart Filters

* Chart Variants (e.g. line, bar, etc.)

* Chart View (e.g. year, month, week, etc.)

* Chart Interactions (e.g. zoom to change view)

* MySQL Database

* Authentication
